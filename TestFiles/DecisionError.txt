# NOTE
_global = YEAH
# NOTE
_global2 = 2222


# problem is with decision here: If(GlobalSectionDontExistInFile && UserDontWantToCreateGlobal) -> Note on first line should be associated with pair or global section? Pair looks more optimal right?!
# FIXED in parser!


Second example is quite predictable:


# NOTE WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH GLOBAL HERE!
[]
_global = YEAH
# NOTE
_global2 = 2222
